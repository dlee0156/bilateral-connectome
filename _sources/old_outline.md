# Outline

## Main
### Figure x - Look at it
#### A - Plot of the brain in 3D space
#### B - Plot of the brain left and right hemispheres in graph layout
#### C - Table of summary statistics for left and right. # nodes, max degree, density, etc.

### Figure x - Distinction between known and unknown/nonexistent vertex correspondence

### Figure x - Something explaining the non-vertex-aligned tests

### Figure x - Experimental procedure explanation

### Figure x - Power / validity results for the non-vertex aligned tests
- Matrix of figure panels
    - Rows are {null (only one column), add, remove, swap, degree-preserving swap (where applicable)}
    - Columns are {at random over whole graph, subgraph1, subgraph2, etc etc}
    - Each panel is y-axis = p(reject) / power, x-axis is effect size
    - Color represents hypothesis / test
    - Style may have to indicate sub-versions of each 
    - Not sure how to represent uncertainty in this panel
    - Will probably just average left/right

### Figure x - Something explaining the vertex-aligned texts

### Figure x - Power / validity results for the vertex-aligned tests

## Supplement

### Figure x - Each test in depth
- May want to show distribution of p-values for a few (or all) of the tests with varying
effect size

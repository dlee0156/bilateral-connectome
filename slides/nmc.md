# What is a connectome? (for *this* talk)

A **connectome** is a network model of brain structure consisting of <span style="color: #ed7d31"> nodes which 
represent individual neurons </span> and <span style="color: #4472c4"> edges which represent the presence of a synaptic 
connection </span> between those neurons.

---
# Many connectomics questions require comparison
- Understand wiring substrate of learning/memory
- Understand links between genetics or disease and connectivity
- Understand how different neural architectures lead to different computational abilities

> "Understanding statistical regularities and learning which variations are stochastic and which are secondary to an animalâ€™s life history will help define the substrate upon which individuality rests and require comparisons between circuit maps within and between animals." [1]

# Larval _Drosophila_ brain connectome

# Are these populations the same? 
- Known as two-sample testing
- $Y_1 \sim F_1$, $Y_2 \sim F_2$
- $H_0: F_1 = F_2$  vs.  $H_A: F_1 \neq F_2$

# A slightly more complicated thing one could do: stochastic block model (SBM)
- describe the SBM

# An even more flexible model: Random dot product graph (RDPG)
